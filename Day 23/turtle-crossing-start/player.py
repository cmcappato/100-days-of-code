# Detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens.

# Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen (i.e., reached the FINISH_LINE_Y).
# When this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars.
# Hint: think about creating an attribute and using the MOVE_INCREMENT to increase the car speed.
